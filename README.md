# Retail-Sales-Analysis-using-Confidence-Intervals-CLT

This project demonstrates statistical inference techniques on retail sales data to estimate population parameters and validate sampling behavior using the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).

üìå Objectives

Understand and estimate key sales metrics using confidence intervals.

Apply the Central Limit Theorem to simulate sampling distributions.

Draw actionable insights on weekly sales patterns and variation.

üîç Key Analyses Performed

Confidence Interval Estimation: Computed 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals for weekly sales to estimate population mean with varying levels of certainty.

Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Demonstration: Generated sampling distributions for different sample sizes (n=30, 50, 100), illustrating how the sampling distribution of the mean approaches normality.

Visual Analysis: Plotted histograms and overlayed normal curves to compare sample vs population distributions.

Insights: Identified consistent sampling behavior aligned with CLT expectations and showed how larger sample sizes yield narrower confidence intervals, improving estimation accuracy.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats

Jupyter Notebook: For step-by-step implementation and commentary
